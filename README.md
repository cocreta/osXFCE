A fork of the arc-flatabulous theme. 

I'm working to combine arc-flatabulous with the elementary theme to create the ultimate macOS-like gtk 3 theme.
I use XFCE with the vala-panel-appmenu plugin, so I'm designing and tweaking around this desktop environment. At the moment, I am working on the light theme, but I may create a dark theme in the future once I am satisified with the results of this theme.

Development is most likely somewhat slow since I am learning GTK theme development as I go, with a lot of trial and error.
